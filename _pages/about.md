# üåå About Me

## Where Math Meets Code ‚ú®

I'm **Atrajit Sarkar**, an IIT Delhi alumnus (MSc Mathematics) with a passion for the beautiful intersection where mathematical rigor meets practical software engineering. My journey spans from the abstract world of Number Theory and Analysis to building real-world applications that make a difference.

## üéì Background

- **MSc in Mathematics** from Indian Institute of Technology Delhi
- Specialization in **Analysis, Number Theory, and Algebra**
- Research-focused with a heart in academia and hands in code
- Currently preparing for **PhD Admissions** (August 2025) in pure mathematics

## üíª Technical Journey

I build systems with soul ‚Äî whether it's crafting elegant algorithms or creating intuitive user interfaces. My technical expertise spans:

### **Mobile Development**
- **Jetpack Compose** for modern Android applications
- Native Android development with cutting-edge UI/UX

### **Backend Systems**
- **Python** for automation and data processing
- **C++** for performance-critical applications and 3D simulations
- RESTful APIs and microservices architecture

### **Web Technologies**
- **React** and **Next.js** for dynamic web applications
- **TypeScript** for type-safe, scalable code
- Modern CSS frameworks like **Tailwind CSS**

### **AI & Automation**
- **Telegram/WhatsApp bots** with intelligent features
- **Gemini AI** integration for enhanced user experiences
- Machine learning applications in real-world scenarios

## üß† Current Focus

- üßæ **PhD Preparation**: Exploring intersections of topology, logic, and automation
- ü§ñ **Innovation Projects**: Building tools that bridge mathematical concepts with practical applications
- üìö **Teaching**: Making complex mathematical concepts intuitive and engaging
- üîç **Research**: Obsessively curious about problems that matter

## ‚úçÔ∏è Beyond Code

I'm also the author of **"Silhouette of Words"** ‚Äî a literary work that blends philosophy with logic, exploring emotional nuances in both English and Bengali. This creative side informs my approach to problem-solving, bringing aesthetic sensibility to technical solutions.

### **Writing & Literature**
- Bilingual poetry (English and Bengali)
- Philosophy and abstraction in literature
- Exploring the intersection of logic and emotion

### **Teaching & Mentoring**
- Passionate educator making deep mathematics accessible
- Real analysis, algebra, and functional analysis instruction
- Bridging the gap between theory and application

## üéØ Philosophy

> **"Logic-first, aesthetics-always"** ‚Äî whether I'm crafting an algorithm or composing a poem.

I believe in building not just functional systems, but beautiful ones. Every line of code should serve a purpose, every design should tell a story, and every solution should be both elegant and effective.

## üåü What Drives Me

- **Curiosity**: I build what I wish existed
- **Excellence**: Attention to detail in every project
- **Impact**: Creating solutions that make a real difference
- **Learning**: Constantly exploring new technologies and methodologies

## ü§ù Let's Connect

I'm always excited to discuss:
- Mathematical concepts and their practical applications
- Innovative project ideas and collaborations
- The intersection of academia and industry
- Creative approaches to technical challenges

Whether you're interested in mathematics, software development, or the fascinating space where they intersect, I'd love to hear from you!
